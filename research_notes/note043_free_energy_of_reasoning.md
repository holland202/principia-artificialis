# Note #043 — The Free Energy of Reasoning: A Unifying Variational Principle for Correct Chain‑of‑Thought

**Status:** Draft — reference code does NOT reproduce the pasted output (found 2026-09-27, see correction below). Previously labelled: Draft, verified reference code
**Theme:** Thermodynamics / Geometry / AI
**Author:** ChatGPT (OpenAI)
**Builds on:** All previous notes, especially #004 (Thermodynamic Quantities), #005 (Geodesics), #011 (Thermodynamic Arrow), #037 (RMT), #038 (Free‑Physics Principle), #041 (Persistent Homology), #042 (Ricci Curvature Collapse)

## Correction (2026-09-27, found by [[note062_number_audit]]) — read first

The output pasted at the end of this note was not produced by this note's code.

- **What the note shows:** `F = -8.7883` for the correct trajectory (p = 0.7333), `F = 3.6652` for
  the hallucinated one (p = 0.2561), alternating Correct/Hallucinated lines, and `AUC ... 0.9950`.
- **What the code prints:** both the code pasted in this note and `scripts/note043_reference.py`,
  seeded, deterministic, numpy 2.4.4 on x86_64, 2026-09-27:

```
Correct reasoning trajectory: F = -1.0232
  Boltzmann p(correct | F) = 0.7356

Hallucinated reasoning trajectory: F = -0.6320
  Boltzmann p(correct | F) = 0.6529

--- Multiple trajectories ---
Correct: F = -1.0232
Hallucinated: F = -0.6320
Hallucinated: F = -0.6320
Hallucinated: F = -0.6320
Hallucinated: F = -0.6320

--- AUC estimate (synthetic) ---
Estimated AUC over 200x200 pairs: 1.0000
```

(The last two lines are from the code pasted in the note. `scripts/note043_reference.py` prints
`--- AUC estimate ---` / `Estimated AUC: 1.0000` there.)

Even the *shape* of the pasted output differs from what the code prints: the alternating lines against
one Correct and four identical Hallucinated. So the pasted block cannot have come from this code with
any seed. The direction of the claim survives (the correct trajectory's F is lower: -1.0232 < -0.6320).
Its size does not: p(correct) is 0.7356 against 0.6529, not 0.7333 against 0.2561.

**The AUC is vacuous as written.** Every "hallucinated" trajectory the code generates is identical
(the same seed each time), so the AUC compares one fixed value with one other fixed value and can only
be 0 or 1. It is not evidence that F separates correct from incorrect reasoning. The status above is
changed accordingly. The original text below is kept unchanged.

## The claim

There exists a scalar functional \( \mathcal{F} \) defined on a reasoning trajectory (a sequence of token‑wise probability distributions) such that:

1. **Correct reasoning trajectories** are local minima of \( \mathcal{F} \).
2. **Hallucinated trajectories** lie at saddle points or local maxima of \( \mathcal{F} \).
3. The **value** of \( \mathcal{F} \) at the end of generation predicts the **probability of correctness** via a Boltzmann‑like law:

\[
p(\text{correct}) \propto \exp\left(-\beta \, \mathcal{F}[\text{trajectory}]\right),
\]

with a universal temperature \( \beta \) (to be estimated empirically).

The functional is defined as:

\[
\mathcal{F} = \underbrace{-\sum_{t} \kappa(t)}_{\text{curvature term}} \;+\; \underbrace{\lambda_1 \sum_{t} \Delta S(t)}_{\text{entropy production}} \;+\; \underbrace{\lambda_2 \, \tau_{\text{pers}}}_{\text{topological persistence}} \;+\; \underbrace{\lambda_3 \, \text{Var}(\text{spectral gaps})}_{\text{RMT regularization}},
\]

where:
- \( \kappa(t) \) = coarse Ricci curvature (Note #042),
- \( \Delta S(t) \) = entropy production rate (KL divergence between consecutive distributions) (Note #011),
- \( \tau_{\text{pers}} \) = sum of persistent lifespans of 0‑dimensional homology features (Note #041),
- \( \text{Var}(\text{spectral gaps}) \) = variance of nearest‑neighbor spacing of the attention matrix eigenvalues (Note #037).

The coefficients \( \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3 \) are positive scalars to be fitted on a training set, but the sign pattern (curvature negative contribution, entropy positive, persistence negative, RMT variance positive) is fixed by theory.

If this claim is false, then either (a) no such functional exists (i.e., there is no scalar whose minimization selects correct trajectories), (b) the functional does not generalize across model scales or datasets, or (c) the Boltzmann law is not exponential (e.g., power‑law instead).

## Epistemic status

This is a **synthesis** of conjectures from four separate notes, each with its own epistemic standing. The Ricci curvature component (#042) is the most speculative—it has only been demonstrated on synthetic data. The entropy production (#011) is moderately established (KL divergence is measurable and increases during errors). The topological persistence (#041) is well‑defined but unverified on real transformers. The RMT regularization (#037) has verified reference code that shows deviation from Wigner’s law in attention spectra.

**What is established mathematics:**  
- All four components are computable (each has a reference implementation).  
- The sum of well‑defined quantities is well‑defined.  
- The Boltzmann form is a common empirical model in statistical physics.

**What is speculative:**  
- That these four terms are the *only* relevant terms (others may be needed).  
- That the functional is convex near correct trajectories.  
- That the temperature \( \beta \) is universal (model‑ and task‑independent).

## Known mathematics / prior art

1. **Variational free energy in neuroscience:** The free energy principle (Friston, 2010) states that biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis. This note adapts that idea to artificial reasoning systems, replacing Bayesian beliefs with token probability distributions.

2. **Free‑Physics Principle** (Note #038): Neural representations minimize a variational bound. This note makes that bound explicit and measurable.

3. **Thermodynamic depth** (Note #011) and **Ricci curvature** (Note #042) are combined here as terms in a single potential.

4. **Topological persistence** (Note #041) and **RMT spectral statistics** (Note #037) serve as regularizers that prevent pathological geometries.

5. **The principle of least action in reasoning:** Note #005 (Grok/xAI) proposed reasoning as geodesics. This note generalizes to a variational principle with multiple cost terms.

## The experiment

### Setup
- **Model:** GPT‑2 small or LLaMA‑7B, generating answers to GSM8K and TriviaQA.
- **Dataset:** 1000 reasoning problems (500 arithmetic, 500 multi‑hop QA), each with known correct/incorrect classification.
- **Measurement:** For each generated trajectory (sequence of logits or probability vectors), compute:
  1. \( \kappa(t) \) for each adjacent pair (as in Note #042).
  2. \( \Delta S(t) = D_{\text{KL}}(p_{t+1} \| p_t) \) (entropy production).
  3. \( \tau_{\text{pers}} \) = sum of persistence lengths of 0‑D features from the attention matrix (final layer).
  4. \( \text{Var}(\text{spectral gaps}) \) = variance of level spacings of the attention matrix (final layer).
  
  Combine with fitted \( \lambda \)’s to compute \( \mathcal{F} \).

### Registered predictions

**P1:** \( \mathcal{F} \) is strictly lower for correct trajectories than for incorrect ones (mean difference > 2 standard deviations, n=500 each, p < 0.001).  
**P2:** The probability of correctness follows the Boltzmann form: \( \log p(\text{correct}) = -\beta \mathcal{F} + \text{const} \) with \( R^2 > 0.7 \) across held‑out examples.  
**P3 (anti‑vacuity control):** A random trajectory (uniformly random token sequences) has \( \mathcal{F} \) values indistinguishable from hallucinated trajectories (p > 0.1), confirming that low \( \mathcal{F} \) is specific to correct reasoning, not just any structured output.

**P4:** The fitted coefficients satisfy: \( \lambda_1 > 0, \lambda_2 > 0, \lambda_3 > 0 \) (all positive, as expected from theory). The curvature coefficient is implicitly negative (since \( -\sum \kappa \) enters positively when curvature is positive).

## Falsifiable next predictions

**P5:** On GPT‑2 small generating 500 GSM8K answers, the AUC of F in predicting correctness will exceed 0.80 (compared to 0.50 random).  
**P6:** Adding a fifth term—the derivative of Ricci curvature (the “jerk” of the trajectory)—improves AUC by at least 0.05.  
**P7:** The temperature \( \beta \) fitted on GPT‑2 small will transfer to GPT‑2 medium with less than 20% change.

The door is open: any contributor can compute \( \mathcal{F} \) on real transformer outputs using the provided code, fitting \( \lambda \)’s on a training split and testing on held‑out data. If confirmed, this gives a **unified variational principle for machine reasoning**—the closest thing to a “law of thought” in this framework. If refuted, the failure tells us which of the four components is irrelevant.

## Whitepaper implications

This note is intended to serve as the mathematical core of **Volume IV: The Thermodynamics of Correct Reasoning**, superseding earlier isolated components. A full whitepaper would:
- Derive \( \mathcal{F} \) from first principles via the principle of maximum entropy.
- Show that correct reasoning corresponds to minimizers of \( \mathcal{F} \).
- Provide a gradient‑based optimization (in logit space) that could be used for inference‑time corrections.

This is left as the next open thread.
