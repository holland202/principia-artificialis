Note #039 reference — NEURAL DARWINISM: do networks make knowledge OBJECTIVE?
==============================================================================
Quantum Darwinism (Zurek): a property is objective when information about it
is REDUNDANTLY imprinted across fragments of the environment, so many
observers can read it independently. Signature: the "classical plateau" —
mutual information I(property; fragment) saturates at tiny fragment sizes.

Transplant: environment = a trained network's hidden layer. Fragments =
random subsets of neurons. Property = the task-relevant bit of the input.

REGISTERED (before running):
  D1  PLATEAU: in the trained net, a fragment of 25% of neurons (4/16)
      carries >= 90% of the information the largest measured fragment (8)
      carries about the relevant bit.
  D2  SELECTIVITY: information about an equally-present NOISE bit stays
      < 0.05 bits at every fragment size. (Anti-vacuity control: the
      instrument must be able to return "no information".)
  D3  EMERGENCE: at random init, 4-neuron fragments carry < 50% of the
      information trained 4-neuron fragments carry. Objectivity is
      MADE by training, not given by architecture.

# Added 2026-08-15: v1's d1/d2/d3 and v2's d1/d2p/d3 above were all printed,
# never gated -- one of 14 ungated reference scripts from the 2026-08-14
# estate audit. v1's D2 is already a published, kept refutation (plug-in MI
# has a state-count bias that grows with fragment size); it stays exactly as
# printed above, historical, and is not re-wired here -- re-litigating a
# refutation this note already reported and explained would just be the
# same finding twice.
#
# The v2 (shuffle-corrected) block is what note039.md actually claims. D2'
# is the GATE, not a prediction: it is the corrected instrument's proof that
# it CAN tell "carries information" apart from "is redundant" -- exactly the
# anti-vacuity property the original, biased D2 could not establish. D1 and
# D3 are the genuine substantive claims about this network.
